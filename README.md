# CNN/AttentionLSTM (driver behavior identification)
This model input data took from the previous repository (security dataset). 
The driving data is considered as a multivariate time series classification problem, so we used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), combined with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM).
